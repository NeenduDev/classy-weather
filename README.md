# Classy Weather

Classy Weather is a React project that demonstrates my ability to work with legacy React class components, handling complex and older codebases with ease.

## Overview

This project displays weather data in a simple and clean UI. It was built to demonstrate my proficiency with React, focusing on legacy class-based components rather than functional components with hooks. This showcases my capability to manage and maintain older React codebases effectively.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The core technology used to build the app. The project uses class-based components, providing an example of working with legacy React code.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language.
- **CSS**: For styling the components and creating a responsive layout.
- **Weather API**: Used to fetch real-time weather data (API details are abstracted here).
- **Create React App**: The project was bootstrapped using the Create React App tool for a streamlined development experience.

## Features

- **Class-based Components**: Demonstrates proficiency with React's older syntax and lifecycle methods.
- **Weather Data Fetching**: Integrates with a weather API to fetch current weather conditions.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive and provides a smooth user experience across devices.
